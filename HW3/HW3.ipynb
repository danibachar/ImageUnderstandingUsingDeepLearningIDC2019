    "So far we had to manually implement both the forward and backward passes of our neural network. Manually implementing the backward pass is not a big deal for a small two-layer network, but can quickly get very messy for large complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we can use **automatic differentiation** to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The autograd package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality. When using autograd, the forward pass of your network will define a computational graph. Nodes in the graph will be Tensors,\n",
    "and edges will be functions that produce output Tensors from input Tensors. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to compute gradients with respect to some Tensor, then we set `requires_grad=True` when constructing that Tensor. Any PyTorch operations on that Tensor will cause a computational graph to be constructed, allowing us to later perform backpropagation through the graph. If `x` is a Tensor with `requires_grad=True`, then after backpropagation `x.grad` will be another Tensor holding the gradient of `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may wish to prevent PyTorch from building computational graphs when performing certain operations on Tensors with `requires_grad=True`; for example, we usually don't want to backpropagate through the weight update steps when evaluating a neural network. In such scenarios we can use the `torch.no_grad()` context manager to prevent the construction of a computational graph.\n",

    "In this exercise, you will accomplish the following:\n",
    "1. Train a convolutional network using PyTorch.\n",
    "2. Evaluate your model using a confusion matrix.\n",
    "3. Solve the localization task using regression."

    "\n",
    "1. Complete the `train_model` function in the cell below. This function takes as input the model and additional hyper-parameters, and outputs the best model found on the validation set. \n",
    "2. To babysit the learning process, **you must track the classification accuracy, IoU score and loss on the training and validation datasets and visualize them** (using tensorboard or matplotlib). I have included an implementation of the IoU metric in the file `data\\dataloader.py`.\n",
    "3. Do not perform a massive grid search. Use papers, blogs, MOOCs and online guides to research best hyper-parameters for your model. Once you chose your model. Explain why you chose that architecture and why you think it performs better than other networks you tried - use citation from sources you used.\n",
    "4. You are encouraged to try Google Colab or a free AWS / Google Cloud Platform / Azure available for students. If you have an CUDA capable GPU at home - you are welcome to use it. Training one of our networks on a Core i7 for 10 epochs took 5 minutes and reached 99% classification accuracy and over 0.75 IoU score on the validation set (this took less than a minute using a RTX 2080 Ti GPU).\n",
    "5. **Include only your chosen architecture**. During experimentation, you may add as many cells as you need. Make sure to delete them before submission.\n",
    "6. Training large neural networks may take a while. Make sure your code runs reasonably fast (~30 minutes on CPU and ~5 minutes on GPU).\n",
    "7. **In order to get full marks for this section, reach at least 98% classification accuracy and a IOU score of at least 0.70 on the validation set using a single model, explain the results and include visualizations**.\n",
    "8. You are given a general skeleton for the training function. Feel free to use any different structure."
